## Pokemon fusion API! (Rust)

To get running, make sure you have rust installed. Then run `cargo run` and you're set!

# Future Plans

This is just a fun project to help myself learn rust! Not sure what will come of it but here are some future plans:

- Cache pokemon from API
- Calculate fusion stats
- Cache fusion pokemon as requested
- Host images of fused pokemon (and possibly unfused)
